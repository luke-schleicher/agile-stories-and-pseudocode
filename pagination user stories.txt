OVERARCHING USER STORIES

As a product browser, I want to load a limited amount of products per page, so that my browser displays the products promptly

As a product browser, I want a pagination navigation displayed, so that I can still navigate all the products easily

DETAILED USER STORIES

As a product browser, I want quick "Previous" and "Next" links, so that I can easily go to the next or last page without thinking about what page I'm currently on

As a product browser, I want my current page as well as the pages immediately before and after my current page displayed, so that I have some context for where I am at in the pagination

As a product browser, I always want the first 2 and last 2 pages visible, so that I can quickly navigate to the beginning or end of the product pages

As a product browser, I want all other pages to be replaced with an ellipses so that I don't have to look at all the page numbers
